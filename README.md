This project is to create an optimization algorithm to find a resource-efficient scheme for graph state generation.
This is a collaboration between Ki3 and QBT through US Air Force project.

## Onboarding

Please begin by reading through `examples/startup_guide/`.
This will introduce the most important classes in the software, as well as
our version control, testing and automatic documentation frameworks.

## Contributing

Please use the [PEP8 style](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for code-style consistency.
