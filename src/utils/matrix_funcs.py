    Parameters
    ----------
    ρ : 2D array
        Matrix to trace
    keep : array
        An array of indices of the spaces to keep after
        being traced. For instance, if the space is
        A x B x C x D and we want to trace out B and D,
        keep = [0,2]
    dims : array
        An array of the dimensions of each space.
        For instance, if the space is A x B x C x D,
        dims = [dim_A, dim_B, dim_C, dim_D]

    Returns
    -------
    ρ_a : 2D array
        Traced matrix
