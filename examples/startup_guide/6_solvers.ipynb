    "Our `EvolutionarySolver` is a probabilistic solver where a population of candidate circuits are mutated and repeatedly evaluated / improved. This solver should be flexible/capable of targeting different circuit construction criteria. However, it is not guaranteed to produce a result of a certain quality.\n",

    "Our `DeterministicSolver` follows a polynomial algorithm designed by Li et al, and can deterministically create a given target state. However, it is a) in development at the moment and b) restricted to a very particular objective (i.e. relies on particular hardware, cannot account for noise in the design)."
