# How-to: A hands-on guide

![GraphiQ framework](img/fig1.png)
Graphiq is useful for a variety of use-cases when design photonic quantum technologies.
Here, we will walk a few examples use-cases of the software tools, starting with a simple example of simulating a
quantum circuit, and then move on to more advanced use-cases.
